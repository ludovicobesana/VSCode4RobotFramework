# Intro

Robot Framework is a popular open source test automation framework that helps users automate acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It is written in Python and uses a simple, yet powerful, syntax for writing test cases.

In this repository, I have shared my VSCode setup for working with Robot Framework. It includes a list of the extensions and plugins that I find most useful, as well as some custom settings and configuration options that I have found to be helpful when writing and executing Robot Framework test cases.

I hope that this repository will be useful for others who are looking to set up their own VSCode environment for working with Robot Framework. 

Feel free to browse through the setup and use it as a reference when configuring your own VSCode installation.

Thank you for visiting!
